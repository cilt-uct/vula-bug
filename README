This set of scripts provides the capability to place Sakai's emailed bug reports into a database, and then view
various metrics from the data.

The metrics being generated are for each tool:

1. Number of bugs in the given time period (24 hours, 7 days, etc.). Bugs are associated with specific tools through the /portal/tool/... URLs in the request path.

2. Distinct bugs is the number of "different" bugs, as identified by the "caused at" line in the stack trace. This is a reasonably accurate measure.

3. Affected users is the number of different users affected by bugs for the tool.

4. Impact is a measure of bug reports and affected users per distinct tool bug. It's calculated as (bugs + affected users) / distinct bugs.

5. Weighted impact is Impact weighted according to the number of affected users as a proportion of total affected users in the given time period.

Weighted impact can be considered as a "return on effort" metric, i.e. given X known bugs across your entire Sakai deployment, which tool's bugs should you address first in order to have the greatest impact on end users.

## Install on Server

### 1. Generating a new SSH key (If it doesn't exist already)

1. Open Terminal (as root).
2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.
```
> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
```
3. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
```
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /root/.ssh/vula_bugs
```
4. At the prompt, type a secure passphrase or press Enter for no passphrase.
```
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
```
5. Print public key
```
cat /root/.ssh/vula_bugs.pub
```
6. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account (as described below).

### 2. Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account

1. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.
2. Open `https://github.com/cilt-uct/vula-bug/settings/keys`.
3. Click "Add deploy key".
4. Give it the name of the server that will use the key (title).
5. Paste in the key from the terminal output (above).
6. DO NOT tick the "Allow write access"
7. Click "Add key"

### 3. Clone the repository to the server
```
git clone https://github.com/cilt-uct/vula-bug /usr/local/vula-bug
```
NOTE: you might need to use your own credentials for getting the repository

### 4. Change remote server on server
```
cd /usr/local/vula-bug
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cilt-uct/vula-bug.git
./get.sh
```
NOTE: on `git fetch` it might ask you to authenticate `github.com`, just type `yes` and hit Enter.
